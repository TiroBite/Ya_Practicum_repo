ðŸ¥‡**Project Title:** "Gold Recovery Optimization: Predicting Gold Concentration in the Purification Process"
<br />
<br />
ðŸ“„**Description:**
The objective is to predict the gold recovery coefficient from gold-bearing ore based on mining and purification parameters. 
The model will enable the companies to make informed decisions and maximize the efficiency and profitability of gold purification.
<br />
<br />
ðŸ“Š**Tools Used:**
<br />
- Regression modeling algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression)
- Custom evaluation metrics tailored to the gold recovery optimization task
