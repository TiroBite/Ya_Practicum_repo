Name project -  "Toxicity Classifier: Enhancing Comment Moderation in Online Communities"
<br /> 
<br />
Description project - The Toxicity Classifier project aims to develop a powerful tool for identifying toxic comments in an online platform's user-generated content. 
With the increasing popularity of user-editable product descriptions, similar to wiki communities, it has become essential to have a system that can effectively detect and flag toxic comments. 
This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a classification model capable of identifying toxic comments and sending them for moderation. 
By implementing this tool, the internet marketplace can maintain a healthier and more positive user experience by promptly addressing and moderating toxic content.
